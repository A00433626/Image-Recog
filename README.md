# Image-Recog



Here localization script was still in the progress This script contains all the part code(plate localization,character segmentation,character recognization and ml model for predicting).
openalpr script was previously mentioned but unable to get it.
ocr is used by using pytesseract but that to unable to convert it image to string.
Now working with the loaclization.py. Hope one's come through.
